# Tale about k8s learning

I started this to learn about Kubernetes, from there this repo is just grown into a heavy backend class, wrote 2 backend services just to explore different concepts and rolling out my own auth after so long and had to try all the mordern tech came in past few months (lol just fomo issues)

Explored since starting this:

* 1- Drizzle ORM 🚀
* 2- Fastify ⚡️
* 3- writing my own auth after so so long time
* 4- lot's of DB stuff like migrations how to run that inside Docker containers
* 5- reverse proxy via Caddy
* 6- jsonwebtokens
* 7- joi for validation
* 8- Adminer
* 9- Insomnia
* 10- Bun 🌭
* 11- k8s 🫙
* 12- docker & docker compose 🐳
